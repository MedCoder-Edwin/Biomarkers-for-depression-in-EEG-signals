# Functional Connectivity Analysis of EEG Signals for Depression Biomarker Exploration

## üß† Motivation
Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders worldwide, yet its diagnosis is still largely based on clinical interviews. 
Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive window into brain activity, offering the possibility to identify objective biomarkers of depression.  
This project explores **functional connectivity metrics** applied to EEG data, aiming to uncover potential network-level alterations associated with depressive states.

## üìä Data
- The dataset comprises EEG signals from three sources: an apparently healthy participant and two individuals with major depressive disorder, as provided by the project tutor.  
- Preprocessing steps include filtering, artifact rejection, and segmentation.  
- Connectivity computed across different frequency bands (e.g., delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Preprocessing**  
   - Band-pass and notch filtering
   - Artifact removal  
   - Segmentation into epochs  
   
2. **Functional Connectivity Analysis**  
   - Weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI)
  
3. **Visualization**  
   - Connectivity matrices (per frequency band)

## üìà Results
- Generated connectivity matrices across multiple frequency bands.  
- Preliminary findings suggest differences in connectivity patterns that may relate to depressive states.  
- Example visualization:

## üöÄ Future Work
- Compare connectivity metrics between depressed vs. control groups.  
- Apply graph-theoretical measures (clustering coefficient, small-worldness, modularity).  
- Explore machine learning approaches for classification based on connectivity features.  
- Extend to multimodal data integration (EEG + clinical scores).
